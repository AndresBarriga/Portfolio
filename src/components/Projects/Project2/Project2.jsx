                                    <span class="font-bold">Ensuring reliability and stability of radio signals in different environments: </span>was a challenge because radio signals may be affected by various factors, such as distance, interference, noise, weather, etc., that may reduce their quality or availability. For example, radio signals may are weak or distorted if the radios are too far from the repeater, or if there are other radio devices or electromagnetic sources nearby (what typically happens in our clients environment).</div>

                                <div className="mt-2">
                                    <span class="font-bold">Ensuring user-friendliness and usability of the product for different users and scenarios.:</span> some users prefer a simple interface and functionalities, while others may prefer a complex and customizable interface. Some scenarios required a quick and easy access to the product features, while others required a detailed and thorough explanation of the product features.</div>

                                Conducting extensive research and testing on different devices and platforms to ensure compatibility and interoperability. I used various tools and methods, such as device emulators, compatibility testers, network analyzers, etc., to simulate and evaluate how different devices and platforms work together. </div>
                                <div className="mt-2">
                                Implementing various security and privacy measures on different devices and platforms to ensure data and communication protection. I used various tools and techniques, such as encryption, authentication, authorization, firewall, VPN, etc.</div>
